# workerstream

    npm install workerstream

use HTML5 [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers) with the node streams API

    var workerstream = require('workerstream')
    var worker = workerstream('my-worker.js')

`worker` is a stream and speaks stream events: `data`, `error` and `end`. that means you can pipe worker output to anything that accepts streams, such as an XHR. you can also pipe data into workers (such as a webcam feed or audio data)

## example

in your app:

```js
var worker = workerstream('worker.js')
worker.on('data', function(data) {
  console.log(data)
})
worker.on('error', function(e) { console.log('err', e)})
worker.write({ hello: 'world' })
```

the worker code (`worker.js` above):

```
self.onmessage = function(event) {
  self.postMessage({whats: 'up'})
}
```

## transferable objects

```js
worker.write(arraybuffer, [arraybuffer])
```
